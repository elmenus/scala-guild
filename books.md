## Programming in Scala

Coauthored by the designer of the Scala language, this authoritative book will teach you, one step at a time, the Scala language and the ideas behind it. The book is carefully crafted to help you learn. The first few chapters will give you enough of the basics that you can already start using Scala for simple tasks. The entire book is organized so that each new concept builds on concepts that came before ?? a series of steps that promises to help you master the Scala language and the important ideas about programming that Scala embodies. A comprehensive tutorial and reference for Scala, this book covers the entire language and important libraries. This fourth edition brings the entire book up to date, adding new material to cover changes in Scala 2.13, in particular the overhaul of collections.

  !!! Ahmed Gamal:Good book to start learning about Scala, the language and the reasoning about its features with too much details you can skip some if you want.

## Essential Scala

This book is aimed at programmers learning Scala for the first time. We assume you have some familiarity with an object-oriented programming language such as Java, but little or no experience with functional programming.

Our goal is to describe how to use Scala in-the-small. To this end our focus is on the core patterns used in idiomatic Scala code, and we introduce Scala’s features in the context of the patterns they enable. We are not aiming for exhaustive coverage of Scala’s features, and this text is not a reference manual.

## Scala with Cats

The main goal of this book is to teach system architecture and design using the techniques of modern functional programming. This means designing systems as small composable units, expressing constraints and interactions via the type system, and using composition to guide the construction of large systems in a way that maintains the original architectural vision.

The book also serves as an introduction to the Cats library. We use abstractions from Cats, and we explain the structure of Cats so you can use it without fear in your own code base. The broad ideas are not specific to Cats, but Cats provides an excellent implementation that is beneficial to learn in its own right.

    !!!Ahmed Gamal: Start only once you finished with Essential Scala or any foundation book.
    !!!Ahmed Gamal: Cats official documentation is also sufficient but sometime not strightforwared or simple to understand.    

## Functional Programming in Scala aka _The Red Book_

Functional Programming in Scala is a serious tutorial for programmers looking to learn FP and apply it to the everyday business of coding. The book guides readers from basic techniques to advanced topics in a logical, concise, and clear progression. In it, you'll find concrete examples and exercises that open up the world of functional programming.

## Functional Programming for Mortals with Cats

This book is for the typical Scala developer, probably with a Java background, who is both sceptical and curious about the Functional Programming (FP) paradigm. This book justifies every concept with practical examples, including writing a web application.

This book uses Typelevel Cats 2.1, the most popular Functional Programming framework for Scala. Typelevel has a wealth of accessible and idiomatic learning resources in a welcoming and safe environment.

This book is designed to be read from cover to cover, in the order presented, with a rest between chapters. Earlier chapters encourage coding styles that we will later discredit: similar to how we learn Newton’s theory of gravity as children, and progress to Riemann / Einstein / Maxwell if we become students of physics.
