## Programming Reactive Systems

> Reactive programming is a set of techniques for implementing scalable, resilient and responsive
> systems as per the Reactive Manifesto. Such systems are based on asynchronous message-passing,
> and their basic building-blocks are event handlers. This course teaches how to implement reactive
> systems in Scala and Akka by using high-level abstractions, such as actors, asynchronous
> computations, and reactive streams.
>
> You will learn how to:
>
> - use, transform and sequence asynchronous computations using Future values
> - write concurrent reactive systems based on Actors and message passing, using untyped Akka and Akka Typed
> - design systems resilient to failures
> - implement systems that can scale out according to a varying workload
> - transform and consume infinite and intermittent streams of data with Akka Stream in a non-blocking way
> - understand how back-pressure controls flows of data

- Level: Intermediate to Advanced
- Comment: !!!Ahmed gamal: This one is highly needed for our system as it's all about being reactive. we are using messaging, akka activly but rarely actors.
